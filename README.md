##### GENERAL INFORMATION
___________________

These pieces of code simulate the movement of a spacecraft within two different
gravitational systems, one with a single parent planet, and one with two planets
of equal mass.

##### INSTALLATION & OPERATION
________________________

Requires some way to open and run Python (.py) files, including the VPython and
Math libraries. Download the .zip from the
[project page](https://github.com/gkorgood/Ph235-Orbital-Dynamics-Sim).
Open any of the three .py files (NOTE: 3bodyRK4.py attempts to run the simulation
using a fourth order Runge-Kutta method, but is currentlynon-functional) in a
Python IDE, and run them normally.
